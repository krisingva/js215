// Discussion

// The algorithm for this problem is less complicated than it looks. The
// solution just has to increment a number and check whether it meets the
// criteria of a featured number. The challenge is in doing this efficiently;
// otherwise, there will be many numbers to go through, which will take a
// significant amount of time.

// On this note, the solution uses a function and a mathematical approach that
// work together to improve the processing efficiency. The toOddMultipleOf7
// function returns the next number that is both a multiple of 7 and an odd
// number. Once you have this value, you just need to increment it in steps of
// 14 to cycle through all of the odd multiples of 7. Neat trick, and it makes
// the program significantly faster.

// The featured function checks each multiple to see whether all the digits are
// unique. Since it increments the starting number by 14 during each iteration,
// there is no need to determine whether the number is odd or a multiple of 7 --
// we already know it is.

// The allUnique function uses a seen object to determine whether a digit
// already exists in the number. If the function finds that a digit appears more
// than once while iterating over the digits, then the number is not a featured
// number.
